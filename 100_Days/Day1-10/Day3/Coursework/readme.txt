### --- EXERCISES --- ###


1 - Odd or even
    Create a piece of code that can figure out if the given number is odd or even

2 - BMI Calculator 2.0
    Create a piece of code that acts as a rough BMI Calculator

    ```
    BMI = weight / height x height
    must be rounded to whole number
    ```

    Then add to this code with if statments to give us an output based on the BMI the
    if statements should return one of the following

    Under 18.5 they are underweight
    Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
    Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
    Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
    Above 35 they are clinically obese.

3 - Leap year
    Using if else statements create a piece of code to tell the user if any given year is a leap year

4 - Pizza Order Practice
    Create a piece of code with multiple options that will return total cost when used

    Based on a user's order, work out their final bill.

    Small Pizza: $15
    Medium Pizza: $20
    Large Pizza: $25
    Pepperoni for Small Pizza: +$2
    Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3
    Extra cheese for any size pizza: + $1

    Example:

    size = "L"
    add_pepperoni = "Y"
    extra_cheese = "N"

    Your final bill is: $28.

5 - Love calculater
    Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word 
    TRUE occurs. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 
    Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

    Example:
    name1 = "Angela Yu"
    name2 = "Jack Bauer"

    T occurs 0 times
    R occurs 1 time
    U occurs 2 times
    E occurs 2 times

    Total = 5

    L occurs 1 time
    O occurs 0 times
    V occurs 0 times
    E occurs 2 times

    Total = 3
    Love Score = 53
    Print: "Your score is 53."

    following this the following if statments must be met:

    For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
    "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."

    For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
    "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."

    Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
    "Your score is **z**."
