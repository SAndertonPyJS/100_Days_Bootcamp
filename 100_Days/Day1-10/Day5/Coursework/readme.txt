### --- CURRENT COURSEWORK --- ###

Fundamentals on python loops

### --- GOALS --- ###

TO gain a beginner understanding about python loops, their function and how to use them effectively

### --- EXERCISES --- ###

1. Average height calculator
    Create a script that will take the heights of everyone in a list add them together 
    and return the average using loops. For the exercise we are NOT allowed to use
    len or sum during the addition portion of the code.

    ex input: 
    189 170 121 174 124 187

    ex output: 
    Your heights were [189, 170, 121, 174, 124, 187], the number of students was 6 and the average height is 160.83

2. High score calculator
    Create a piece of code that will loop through a list of scores and find the highest
    score.

    Ex input:
    78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89
    Ex output:
    The highest score in the class is: 91


3. Adding Even Numbers

    You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers 
    from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

    i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

    Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. 
    It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.

    The total should be 2550

4. Fizzbuzz job interview question

    You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

    Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

    When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

    `When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".` 
    `And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"`
    e.g. it might start off like this:

    `1
    2
    Fizz
    4
    Buzz
    Fizz
    7
    8
    Fizz
    Buzz
    11
    Fizz
    13
    14
    FizzBuzz`
