### --- NOTE --- ###

Todays coursework isn't really exercises but more just micro challenges and things designed to test
understanding of the subject matter. They won't always be present as some don't warrent an actual 
challenge and need notation but for new concepts they will be included the same as exercises

1/ Using what you know of OOP use pretty table to create a table that looks like the following:

+------------+----------+
|  Pokemon   |   Type   |
+------------+----------+
| Charmander |   Fire   |
| Bulbasaur  |  Grass   |
|  Squirtle  |  Water   |
|  Pikachu   | Electric |
+------------+----------+

Once you have done this demonstrate ability to change the attributes by changing tables alignment

the end result should look like this:

+------------+----------+
| Pokemon    | Type     |
+------------+----------+
| Charmander | Fire     |
| Bulbasaur  | Grass    |
| Squirtle   | Water    |
| Pikachu    | Electric |
+------------+----------+
