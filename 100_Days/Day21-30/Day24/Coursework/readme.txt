### --- NOTE --- ###

Course work today involved editing up a previous project to include filing. SO instead of having the entire
thing here again I'm just going to leave a note pointing back to Day 20/21 Snake game project with the following
changes:

Using file reading, and after learning about files directories and paths we after

    - Adding a highscore to Snake
    - Adding a file that can write the high scores
    - Changing the game over screen to include the highest scores
    - Adding the ability to write your name into the high score field

(all changes will start with the comment #D.24.CW)
