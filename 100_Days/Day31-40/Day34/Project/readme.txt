### --- PROJECT --- ###

Todays project is a rebuild of our oop quiz project from day 17. The objective was to recreate the project in tkinter and add
additional functionality with api and request usage.

### --- PARAMETERS / HOW IT WORKS --- ###

- Using the open trivia API, questions are gotten and formatted to a list
- These questions are then fed to quiz_brain via object initialization
- The application then takes that question data and sends it to the UI for the user to interact with
- In the ui file the application is built and then the questions are shown on the screen
- The two buttons on the bottom of the application allow the user to guess true or false
- The application compares user to question answer and provides feedback on the result

- The application must:
	- Be able to show the questions formatted into a Q:A format on the screen
	- Have the ability to allow the user to select from true or false with buttons
	- Give the user feedback on their choice
	- Tally the users score and show them at the end
	- wipe and reset the application for the next game
