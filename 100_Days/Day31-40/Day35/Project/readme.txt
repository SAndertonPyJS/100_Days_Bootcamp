### --- PROJECT --- ###

The project for the day is a rain alert program. The app is designed to use api to check the percipitation levels of the area
and if it meets the criteria it will then go and send the user an sms to get an umbrella handy

### --- PARAMETERS --- ###

The app needs to have the following

- The ability to pull the api data from the current region the user is in
- To compare that against data values for rain
- The ability to sms a user the details and message
- The program must also utilize envs as we learnt about virtual envs and environment variables
