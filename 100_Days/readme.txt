General Readme For the 100 days of python repo.

This is a repo containing all my coursework and projects for the 100 days of python coding course.

Objectives

The objective of this course was to provide a fundamental and somewhat comprehensive practical understanding
of the python programming language, it's applications and how to use it in a professional setting. The course
detailed basics from lists, dictionaries, variables and basic concepts all the way to touching on machine learning, data analysis
and management.

The course by itself is not intended to be a be all end all of learning but mainly a starting point. As it stands the aim is to use
what I learn here to gain at minimum entry level development employment and progress my skills. 

Structure

The structure of the folder is as follows:

Split into batches of 10 days

Each 10 Days has a readme detailing the learnt topics, coursework and projects

Each day inside the batch contains a readme detailing the exercises, a coursework folder and a project folder
with the aforementioned coursework and projects.

EX:
	
	Python 100 Days
		Day1-10
			Day_1
				Coursework
				Project
				Readme.txt
			Day_2
				Coursework
				Project
				Readme.txt
		Day11-20
			Day_11
				Coursework
				Project
				Readme.txt

			Day_12
				Coursework
				Project
				Readme.txt

Some days will have no coursework or no projects, as we get further into the course there will be less of the former as those 
are designed primarily to understand the concepts being taught. As we get further this becomes a case of RTFM.
