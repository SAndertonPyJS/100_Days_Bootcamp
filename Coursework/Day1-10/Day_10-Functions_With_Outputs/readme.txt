### --- CURRENT COURSEWORK --- ###

An introduction to functions with outputs, learning how return works

### --- GOALS / WHAT WE LEARN --- ###

To be able to build code that uses returns for simplicity, so far we learnt that functions can
be used to create pieces of code that can execute a set of commands down the road, and give us a result
via print. 

With outputs we learn that functions can actually return the result on the line
they are called and then be directly accessed for further manipulation 

### --- EXERCISES --- ###


1 - Leap Year Revisited
    For this code we want to create additional functionality using functions that will
    enable us to check the specific days of a febuary of that year.

    As we know leap years are determined by there being an extra day in febuary

    SO for this code:

        Change is_leap to return true or false depending on is leap or not
        
        Create a function that will go through the days in a month and return the
        day count depending on the month. The function must also account for the 
        days in febuary aka if it's a leap year returns 29 if not returns 28
