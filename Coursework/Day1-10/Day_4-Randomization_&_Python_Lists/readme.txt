### --- CURRENT COURSEWORK --- ###

Randomisation and python lists

### --- GOALS --- ###

TO gain a beginner understanding about the python random module and lists

### --- EXERCISES --- ###


1 - Heads or tails
    A simple exercise creating a heads or tails program

2 - Banker roulette who will play
    Create some code that will enable the following
        - allow us to submit users names
        - randomly selects one of the users to pay the bill

3 - Treasure map
    using lists create a "Treasure map" that enables you to plot coordinates
    The "map" should update to reflect the coordinates

    ```
    You are going to write a program which will mark a spot with an X.

    In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.

    This map contains a nested list.
    When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:

    ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
    In the starting code, we have used new lines (\n) to format the three rows into a square, like this:

    ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
    ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
    ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
    This is to try and simulate the coordinates on a real map.

    Your job is to write a program that allows you to mark a square on the map using a two-digit system. The first digit is the vertical column number and the second digit is the horizontal row number. e.g.:

    First your program must take the user input and convert it to a usable format.

    Next, you need to use it to update your nested list with an "x".

    EX:

    column 2, row 3 would be entered as:

    23

    ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

    ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

    ['⬜️', 'X', '⬜️']
    ```
