Project 6 - Reeborg CA Maze

###--- PROJECT OBJECTIVES ---###

In the reeborg CA maze puzzle we are greeted with a randomly generated maze with the bot placed in it.

- The bot is always randomly placed
- The goal is always right hand side

The objective is to create a piece of code that will navigate the bot throught the maze to the goal without
failing. Bonus points if it has 100% victory rate.
