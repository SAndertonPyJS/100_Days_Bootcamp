# 100_Days_Bootcamp

Repository containing all my coursework from the 100 Days of python course. I wanted to create a place where I could store this for future revision / use / revisiting and to kind of create an archive of my journey from knowing absolutely nothing to being a somewhat competant developer. 

There are two files of note:

Coursework:
  This will include all my coursework (exercises, challenges ect) as well as a readme for every day outlining the details of each exercise and what I had to accomplish.
  On some days there is a lack of coursework as these were capstones/project days and as a result they are in the second folder

Projects:
  This is folder #2 a folder of all projects the course had me complete to hone my skills, these will be from the most basic concatination projects all the way up to database post   sql and analysis projects. All will be included with a readme of what they were meant to achieve
  
Adding to this I have made the decision to add a venv file to each course/ project day to ensure that all the required packages are installed so nothing needs to be added on for anyone wanting to download and view this work.

The end goal is as stated above but largely to also create a potential resource I can point to, to show my skill / knowledge and allow me to proverbially get my foot in the door for employment in the field.
